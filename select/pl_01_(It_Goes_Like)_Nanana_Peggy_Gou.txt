I can't explain
I got a feeling that I just
I can't erase
Just a feeling that I won't
Won't leave behind
Because it's somethin that is on
It's on my mind
-
I guess it goes like na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
I can't explain
I got a feeling that I just
I can't erase
Just a feeling that I won't
Won't leave behind
Because it's somethin that is on
It's on my mind
I guess it goes like na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
I can't explain
I got a feeling that I just
I can't erase
Just a feeling that I won't
Won't leave behind
Because it's somethin that is on

I guess it goes like na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
